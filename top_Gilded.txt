  u'I think I speak for most respectable gym-goers when I say Fuck that guy! A guy sort of freaked out on me once for the same reason. I re-stacked a set of 35lbs dumbells that were on the floor, I had my headphones in so I couldn\'t hear but apparently he was yelling from across the gym not to touch them. When he came over and tapped me on the shoulder I couldn\'t believe how angry he was. He said he wasn\'t done with them, picked them back up, placed them back on the floor and walked away. \nLuckily for me, being a pretty strong dude and him being a pretty small one I proceeded to pick up 120lbs dumbells and placed them over top his 35lbs (the only ones in the gym). The look on his face when he came to use them was priceless. I just looked at him and said "sorry I\'m not done with those".\n\n*Thanks for GOLD everyone! And remember, KEEP CALM &amp; ROID-RAGE ON!!',

  u"Shoulders: Military press, Arnold Press, Lateral raises, Shrugs\n\nBack: Rows, rear deltoid flys\n\nChest: Press, Flys\n\nArms: Reverse curls, hammer curls, tricep extensions \n\nLegs: Split stance squats, Goblet squats\n\n\nEdit: I also forgot to mention my favorite exercise, farmers walks! Grab some heavy dumbells and see how far you can walk. Pick a weight that's hard to handle for more than roughly 50-100 feet. 10/10 for conditioning and it utilises heaps of stabilising muscles.  \n\n\n\nDouble Edit: Yo, thanks for the gold! ",

  u"I broke two lil' bench PRs during the week, somehow. 95lbsx5paused --&gt; 100x5paused, and 100x3paused --&gt; 105x3paused.\n\nI'm a 157lb girl on a cut. They aren't impressive numbers but my bench has always been shit and... I'm on a cut! And a girl!! This shouldn't be happening but I'll take it! Maybe its my body's apology for straining my quad and fucking shit up for me.\n\nAlso reached my mini goal weight for the end of March. Feels good",

  u'I feel like something obvious she\'s not really articulating is that,  yes, men are going to be more attracted to you physically now that you\'re more physically atractive. Duh. She gets that,  we all do.\n\nWhat\'s disheartening is how you get treated differently, as if now you\'re worth more.  Exact same person but in a different package. It just makes you sad that as a woman so so much more of your worth as a person is judged by your body not your accomplishments,  outlook, or personality. \n\nLike do any of you get upset that some super hot girl doesn\'t want you or is shitty or shallow? Well why the fuck should she be anything else,  she can get away with it. She figured out the most easily marketable part of her being and focused on it and is objectivity "winning". \nTake Kim Kardashian for example. How many men would still fuck her?  Lots. Now I don\'t feel like this is the best thing to be envious of,  but hey human nature,  hormones and competition and all that. But now how about date? Less, but still a fuck load. Marry and have children with?  Still astronomically high. Horrendous vapid dipshit but objectivly very sexy. Choice of partners, the unsolicited kindness of strangers,  etc etc. all hers. Your options as a woman are to be an incredibly amazing human being with everything going for you and still come in second to the hot dipshit.\n\nLike why the balls do you not get why slut shaming by *other women* is a thing?  Yes it\'s partly jealousy, but it\'s also resentment that these girls are essentially setting the goal posts somewhere they can\'t ever hope to score (ie being unattractive not just chubby or something changeable).\n\nThis sort of went off on a tangent but being a woman who\'s weight has yoyoed quite a bit and (and I get uncomfortable saying it) but has a pretty face,  I\'ve experienced what it\'s like from being a 2 all the way to being a 10 (ish?) And I can tell you 50 lbs less than I am now I could do *no wrong*, 40lbs ago I was wallpaper.  Funny, witty wallpaper. Now that I\'ve lost the 40lbs at my current job the guys I laughed and joked with before, laugh a little harder and linger a little longer to talk to me. And don\'t give me that increased confidence bullcrap either, I\'m still as muddled in my self destructive personality problems as ever (depressed, negative) just the packaging is changing (hell I even wear my same too big uniform shirt and look appallingly sloppy for it!) And the change in attention is alarming.\n\n I really feel like lots of guys just can\'t appreciate how having someone wanting to fuck you is not its own reward.  It\'s certainly not for all women (dare I say most?).  Sex is great but even being the gross lumpy mess I am now I could get 80% of single guys I randomly approach to fuck me. It\'s not particularly challenging.  That\'s not the goal.  I want them to want *me* but I know I\'ll have to turn their head for some length of time before they become attracted to my personality because my big fat body is apparently obscuring the view. \n\nAaand this went on for too long but I\'m in too deep,  I mentioned I\'m a woman and gave a woman\'s perspective on reddit. Queue the ultra defensive replies telling me I\'m somehow illogical. Imma go get more drunk and avoid that glowing little envelope forever. \n\nTl;Dr Less of a man\'s worth in society is tied to his physical appearance, much much more of a woman\'s is and it *shockingly* makes woman a little sad when they\'re reminded of it,  even if it is "positive" discrimination.

  u"You need to read the wiki and stick to a beginner weightlifting routine. Your current routine is most likely unsustainable if you're looking to progress to higher wait.\n\nAs for bad posture during deadlifts, your problem is likely mobility. Look up a few yoga poses: forward fold, pigeon pose, child's pose, intense side stretch pose, and downward dog. Do each of those poses for 30 seconds each, twice a day. Three times per day if your job involves sitting for hours on end. After two weeks, see if you can deadlift light with a straight back.",
