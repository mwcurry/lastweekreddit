# Description
Flask-basked python web app that displays the best of Reddit for user-defined subreddit's for last week.

# To Dos
*General*
- Improve celery integration
- Improve project structure
- Improve speed by improving reddit API integration

*Operations*
- Better algorithm to determine top posts (in other words, am I missing anything good by my current method?)

*Web*
- Improve user interface. Looks okay but could be better.

*User*
- Allow front end user to refresh single subreddit through GUI (versus secret URL)
